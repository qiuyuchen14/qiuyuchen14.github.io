Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington advised by [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) and [Abhishek Gupta](https://abhishekunique.github.io/). 
My research interests are imitation learning and robot manipulation. I'm particularly interested in
learning to generate diverse data for robots such that learning from limited data is possible. Prior to my PhD life, I did my master 
from Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Washington advised by [Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) and [Imari Sato](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~imarik/). I am also fortunate to have interned with many awesome mentors in the past at
National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo), Microsoft Research (Redmond), NNAISENSE (Lugano), Nvidia Robotics Lab (Seattle) and Meta robotics lab (Pittsburgh). 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, painting, movies, cooking, hiking, board games, and recently snorkeling :)
