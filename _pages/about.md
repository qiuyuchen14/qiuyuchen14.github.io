I am a Ph.D. student at the university of Washington advised by [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) and [Abhishek Gupta](https://abhishekunique.github.io/). 
My research interests are robot manipulation, computer vision and machine learning. These days, I'm particularly interested 
in dexterous manipulation, learning from demonstration and self-supervised learning. Prior to my phd life, I did my master 
from Electrical Engineering Department at the Unviersity of Washington advised by [Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) and [Imari Sato](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~imarik/). I am also fortunate to have interned with many awesome mentors in the past at
National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo), Microsoft Research (Redmond), NNAISENSE (Lugano) and Nvidia Robotics Lab (Seattle). See full [CV]().
