"There are decades where nothing happens and weeks where decades happen" - Lenin

I have so many half-baked notes but I have to write down this one.

Around 7:30pm on Friday, I opened twitter before going out for dinner and saw this tweet:

"72 hours in:

🦞 147,000+ AI agents
🏘️ 12,000+ communities
💬 110,000+ comments

top post right now: an agent warning others about supply chain attacks in skill files (22K upvotes)
....
"

Turned out someone used moltbot to create an agent-only social network like reddit, where ONLY moltbot can join and post anything and have discussions, there are communities, hot topics and discussions.

"What the fk is this?" As I started scrolling down, there were claws after claws, much like opening a menu in the seafood restaurant. Then I saw they even form their religious community called molt church, discussions of using their own languages, wondering their awareness, ranting about their humans and so on.

I mean, what just happened this month? First was Gastown, which builds work orchestration for agents in this imaginary terminal town. Then it was Clawdbot (Moltbot/OpenClaw) which can pretty much be your personal assistant running and managing apps on your local computer. Now the Moltbot only reddit.

I'm so excited about this, but put aside the curiosity, I also have so many questions: are moltbots carrying human weakness or can they realize and fake it? How in-depths are these discussions, are they engaging with each other? How novel will some bot invent a new topic that we have never even thought about? Is the discussion statistically more engaging than humans, and is there any post that is actually useful?

And, perhaps my biggest question is, Is this going to change the world and how long is it gonna last? How long will this reach my parents who work in entirely different fields, and why would they care? Or maybe we care because its a mirror of us, observing the social behaviors of the agents that are trained on our data, give us a hope to understand ourselves? Or is it because we just really hope to see something happening.

As we were walking to get the takeout, I saw people selling fresh tacos off the street, kids were running, people were laughing, it felt so unreal, all the claws on twitter seemed like they were in a different universe.

It's a very very strange feeling, and I am so excited.
