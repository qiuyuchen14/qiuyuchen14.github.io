In August 2025, Aaron and I started having some thoughts on moving to SF after staying in Boston for a year. After coming to a friend’s wedding in SF later in September, it became very clear that this was going to happen. We just did not anticipate it would happen in 2.5 months.

After several busy weeks in Oct and Nov, we started preparing everything about two weeks ahead the trip: finding a place in SF, finding a subletter in Boston, renewing our plates and drivers license, planning a cross-country drive, moving our stuff to the storage, booking hotels and train tickets for the later china trip, goodbye dinners with boston friends, shipping our computers to a friend in the bay, and so many more. It felt a little insane at the beginning, but I’m grateful I did it with my best teammate.

“Crazy December” started on a cold morning shortly after Thanksgiving. We and our dog Toast squeezed into our 2005 Prius, packed with a robot, a 3D printer, GPUs, monitors, and one bag of clothes, and started our journey to the west. One week later, we were on a plane from SF to China. Two weeks after that, we drove to Portland to drop off Toast with Aaron’s mom, drove back the next day, and finally settled officially into SF on January 1, 2026. 

As we drove on New Year’s Day, I remember telling Aaron that starting the year with a long drive probably said something about this year ahead: always moving.
